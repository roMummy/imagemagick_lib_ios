# imagemagick_lib_ios

imagemagick compile script.
thank you by [marforic](https://github.com/marforic/imagemagick_lib_iphone).
I changed the script, which is great for me.

If you canâ€™t compile successfully, then I have compiled lib here, right here `IMPORT_ME`
this is imagemagick info:

```
* you can remove local lib by brew 

```
brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies webp
```
or

* recompile the new library.
